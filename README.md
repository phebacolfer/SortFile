# SortFile

###### This program sorts a list of strings contained within a file named "Sort Me.txt" first by string length, then alphabetically, and finally returns the sorted list to stdout

###### By compiling and running the CSC499HW3 file in the terminal, the UpdatedFileSort forward and UpdatedFileSort reverse are automatically run and compared to the expected output in "Sorted Text.txt" and "Reverse SortedText.txt"
