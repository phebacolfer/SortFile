# SortFile

###### This program sorts a list of strings contained within a file named "Sort Me.txt" first by string length, then alphabetically, and finally returns the sorted list to stdout

###### To use, compile and run in the terminal. Use r as an argument if you want the program to reverse the output, otherwise no arguments are needed
